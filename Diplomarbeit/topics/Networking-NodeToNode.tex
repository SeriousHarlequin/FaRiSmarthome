\section{Node-to-Node Communication}
This section discusses important aspects or problems of the communication between
the nodes. Note that the implementation of these aspects is discussed in section
\ref{sec:farilib_espnow}.

    \subsection{ESP NOW Discovery}
    To discover other ESP-NOW devices, a broadcast can be sent
    from the Bridge-Node to all other ESP-NOW devices. This
    Way every ESP-NOW device can discover the bridge and send
    their MAC-Address in return.

    \subsection{Circumventing the Peer Limit}
    To circumvent the 20 peer limit, the bridge can dynamically
    dedicate another peer to act as a second bridge should the
    need arise.
