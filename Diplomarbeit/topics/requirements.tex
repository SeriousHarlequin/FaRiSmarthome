        \subsection{Microcontroller}
        For developing purposes a tool supporting multiple types of microcontrollers
        as well as the Arduino framework is required. In addition, libraries
        for the following purposes are needed:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ESP-NOW communication
            \item HTTPS fetch and post requests
            \item reading and controlling various actuators and sensors
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Backend}
        To record and read previous data, a database is needed, it should ideally be 
        working with time series data and be able to handle a large amount of data, 
        as it will mainly be used for storing sensor data.

        \subsection{Frontend}
        The frontend should be able to visualize the data stored in the database,
        control the actuators and sensors, and display the current state of the 
        system. To implement this, a high-level web framework is preferred to 
        simplify the development process.
