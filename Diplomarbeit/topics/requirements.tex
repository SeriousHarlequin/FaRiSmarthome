\chapter{Requirements} \setAuthor{Fabian Sch√§tzschock}
The following chapter will outline the requirements for the 
project. It describes what concepts and technologies are needed
to implement the project.
    \section{Hardware}
        \subsection{Microcontroller}

    \section{Software}
        \subsection{IDE}
        For developing purposes an IDE fulfilling the following criteria is needed:
        \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
            \item \textbf{Integrates the Arduino framework:}
            Needs to integrate Arduino as most of the code will be written using it.
            \item \textbf{Support for different microcontrollers:}
            Supporting different microcontrollers, to allow for flexibility
            in developing new Nodes.
            \item \textbf{Manages Library integration:}
            Streamlines installing and managing libraries used in the project.
            \item \textbf{Free:}
            To allow anyone to easily modify  or create their own smart home
            using this project as a base.
            \item \textbf{Compiling and uploading code:} 
            Simplifying the process of uploading code to the microcontroller.
            \item \textbf{Edit Code through SSH:}
            Streamline the process of editing and executing code remotely
        \end{itemize} 

            \subsubsection{Visual Studio Code}
            \subsubsection{PlatformIO}

        \subsection{Microcontroller Framework and Tools}

        \subsection{Communication between Nodes}
        
            \subsubsection{Note-to-Note}
            Communication between nodes should be possible between any two nodes
            both ways.

            \subsubsection{Note-to-Server}
            Communication between the nodes and the web server, as well as the 
            database, should be possible both ways.

        \subsection{Backend}
        To record and read previous data, a database is needed, it should ideally be 
        working with time series data and be able to handle a large amount of data, 
        as it will mainly be used for storing sensor data.

        \subsection{Frontend}
        The frontend should be able to visualize the data stored in the database,
        control the actuators and sensors, and display the current state of the 
        system. To implement this, a high-level web framework is preferred to 
        simplify the development process.
