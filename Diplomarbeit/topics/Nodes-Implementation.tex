\section{Node Implementation} \label{sec:node_implemtenation}
This section describes the implementation of the different nodes and the ESP-NOW
discovery process.
    \subsection{Bridge Node} 
    The bridge node is the central node in the network. It is responsible for
    handling all incoming messages from the nodes and distributing them to the
    correct destination.

    \subsection{Basic Node}
    Every Node (except the bridge node) consists of the same base module. It's
    capable of measuring the ambient temperature and controlling four RGB-LEDs.

    \subsection{ESP-NOW Discovery}
    The ESP-NOW discovery process is a crucial part of the system. It allows the
    bridge node to discover new nodes and allows the slave nodes to find the bridge
    node. The process is as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A activating slave Node sends periodic discovery broadcasts.
        \item The bridge node listens for these broadcasts and saves the
        sender's MAC address.
        \item The bridge node sends a response to the slave node with its 
        MAC address.
         
    \end{enumerate}
