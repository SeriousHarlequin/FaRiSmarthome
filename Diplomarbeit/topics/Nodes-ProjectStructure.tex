\section{Project Structure} \label{sec:node_project_structure}

This section describes the project structure of the nodes
and how functionality is meant to be extended. Every Project
should make use of the FaRiLib library (see section \ref{sec:farilib})
and follow a similar structure.

    \subsection{Slave Node}
    Ideally there should only be one slave binary that is able to 
    run on all slave Nodes. This means, unless there is a good 
    reason, new functionality should be implemented into the preexisting
    slave project.
        \subsubsection{Adding new Functionality}
        To add new functionality to the slave node, the following steps
        should be taken:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Create a new task that handles the new functionality
            \item Add the new case to the switch statement in the
            \texttt{Setup} function choosing what tasks to activate
            \item Adjust the Web server to display the data
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Bridge Node}
