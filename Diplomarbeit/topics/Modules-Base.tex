\section{Basic Module}
Every Node (except the bridge node) consists of the same base module. It's
capable of measuring the ambient temperature and controlling four RGB-LEDs.
The functionality of the basic node can be extended by attaching another
module to the base module. 

There were multiple revisions of the basic node. Revision 1.0 was designed to
be a very rough prototype to test the functionality of the basic node and to 
test the concept of an attachable battery. Revision 2.0 was designed to be a 
more polished version of the basic node, all the other modules were designed 
and developed alongside this version.

The revisions of the basic node are presented backwards in this document, from
the latest to the oldest design.
