\subsection{Base Software}
The base software is the foundation of every node. %NOT DONE AT ALL, THIS ALL WRONG

All slave nodes are customizable and modules can be swapped without flashing

its own thread. In the \texttt{Setup()} function, the module is determined
and the corresponding thread is started.
