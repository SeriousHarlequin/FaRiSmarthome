\section{Motion Detector Module} \setAuthor{Richard Krammer}
This module allows the node to detect motion in its environment. This Module can be 
attached simultaneously with the Battery Module to the Base Module
\subsection {Hardware - V1.1}
In this section the different hardware revisions of the motion detector module is 
described. 

\subsubsection{Sensor}
The PIR sensor EKMB1305111K is used to detect motion. This particular sensor was chosen
for its ability to oversee a wide angel of about 150Â° with a range of 5m, therefor it is
a good choice to observe corridors or rooms in a house.
