\section{Motion Detector Module} \setAuthor{Richard Krammer}

    This module allows the node to detect motion in its environment. This Module can be 
    attached simultaneously with the Battery Module to the Base Module

    \subsection {Hardware - V1.1}
        The Motion Module has two revisions, V1.0 and V1.1. The only difference is that 
        a resisitor was removed from the V1.1 version. The schematic and layout did not 
        change. The resisitor was removed from this print and added to the Base Module
        in order to prevent the GPIO pin from floating.
        
    \subsubsection{Sensor}
        The PIR sensor EKMB1305111K is used to detect motion. This particular sensor was chosen
        for its ability to oversee a wide angel of about 150Â° with a range of 5m, therefor it is
        a good choice to observe corridors or rooms in a house.
