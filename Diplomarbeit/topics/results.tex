\section{Future Plans}
This section discusses future plans outside the scope of this diploma thesis,
meaning possible improvements or extensions to the system.

    \subsection{Circumventing the ESP-NOW Peer Limit}
    To circumvent the 20 peer limit per ESP, the bridge can dynamically
    dedicate another peer to act as a second bridge should the
    need arise. This would theoretically allow for infinite scalability in terms
    of Nodes. Implementing this feature would require major refactoring to the
    bridge's codebase.

    \subsection{Hot-swapping Modules}
    Currently, the modules are determined at boot time. It is possible to run
    a thread that periodically checks the connected module and activates/deactivates 
    the corresponding thread. This would allow for true hot-swapping of modules.

    \subsection{Database}
    Currently, data can only be fetched from the bridge node.
    A future improvement would be to implement a database on the
    server that stores all data. This would allow for more 
    complex queries and data analysis.
