    \section{Our Ambitions}
        Most free smart home solutions are either too limited in
        functionality or depend on a strong WLAN-coverage inside the
        home.
        The goal of this Project is to provide an open source
        smart home solution that enables the user to easily modify 
        and extend the system with their own design. Another goal of
        this project is to provide a smart home solution that does
        not require every node to be reachable via WLAN.

    \section{Definitions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Node:} A whole smart home device that
            consists of a base module and optional extension modules.

            \item \textbf{Module:} A part of a Node that provides
            a specific functionality. An extension module can be
            attached to a Node to extend its functionality.

        \end{itemize}
