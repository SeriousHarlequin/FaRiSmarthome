\subsection{Hardware - V1.1}

    The switch module allows to switch 230V devices on and off and measure the current draw. 
    This module can not be compined with any other module. The switch module has two revisions,
    V1.0 and V1.1.

    \subsubsection{Relay}
        The switch module uses a relay to switch the 230V devices on and off. The relay used is 
        the JW1aFSN from Panasonic. The relay is controlled by a transistor and a flyback diode
        to protect the transistor from the voltage spike when the relay is switched off. The relay
        is rated for 10A at 250VAC.

    \subsubsection{Current-Sensor}

        The current sensor is used to measure the current draw of the switched device. The current
        sensor used is the ACS712ELCTR-20A-S from Allegro. The sensor is rated for 20A and has a sensitivity of 
        100mV/A. The sensor is connected to the microcontroller over an analog pin.

        The available versions of the sensor were +-5A, +-20A, and +-30A. The 20A version was 
        chosen because it covers the current range of the relay.
