There were following requirements for the Node's MCU:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low-cost
    \item Low-power
    \item Small
    \item Highly integrated
    \item Wireless communication
\end{itemize}

One Node itself does only contribute little data to the server, also the Node 
should only be able to communicate with one Module. Therefor the controller 
does not have to be very powerful nor rich in pins. The ESP32-C3 was chosen to 
be the MCU, because it is a low-cost, low-power, small and highly integrated MCU 
which meets the scope of the project. It also offers wireless which is essential
for the communication with the server.
