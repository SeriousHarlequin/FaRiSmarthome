This document discribes some basic syntax and formatting rules as guidelines
for editing this paper. With examples :)

1. Basic formatting rules
    - Use as few chapters as possible.
    - Every chapter (or page if necessary) should set the name of the author
      as the inner footer. This is achieved with the following syntax:
      \setAuthor{<Author Name>}
    - Pictures should always be wraped in a figure that containes a caption and a label. If that is not the case it
      will not be shown in the List of Figures properly or cannot be referenced. Example of a figure:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=<factor>\textwidth]{<filename>.jpg}
            \caption{<description>}
            \label{fig:<figname>}
        \end{figure}
    - Possible chapter divisions are: \section, \subsection, \subsubsection
      A section that should not be numbered can be created like this:
        \section*{<secname>}
    - Lists can be created using the itemize environment:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is an item
            \item This is another item
        \end{itemize}
    - Code should always be within a fitting \lstlisting enviroment:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=<lang>]
            code goes here
        \end{minted}
      If not already defined, this can be done within the rdp.txt file.
